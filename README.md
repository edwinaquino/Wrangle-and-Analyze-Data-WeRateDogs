# Wrangle and Analyze Data - WeRateDogs

In this project I used Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources in a variety of different formats. The puporse of this project is to assess the quality and tidiness of the dataset by Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDog. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. WeRateDogs is a tweet account which rates people's dogs with funny comments about dogs.

Our job on this project is to wrangle the data which consists of:
* Gather data

*Reporting on
  * Data wrangling
